  Phaser 3 Experiment
  <br>
</h1>

This is a [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) experiment with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) with ⚡️ lightning fast HMR through [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

# Install

Use `npm i` (or pnpm i) into both this folder and `editor` if you want to use the cool editor GUI

I personally run the `dev` task of `editor` and the main game at the same time to get fast reload.

Open the game at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
